| **Time** | **Speaker** | **Title** | **Abstract** |
| -------- | ----------- | --------- | ------------ |
| 12:00 pm | Levi Neuenschwander | Learning (Using) Neural Networks | This presentation will cover basic points of neural networks. It will go over their structure and some examples of different types. Neural networks are complicated and have several different working parts, so these, and different examples and types of these parts will be covered as well. To finish, there will be an overview of the current direction of the field and where neural networks are heading. |
| 12:20 pm | Guangzhao Qi | Face recognition: face detection methods | With the rapid development of computer and biomedical engineering technology, biometrics to identify personal identity has become the preferred security verification method.This Presentation will be about face detection from feature-based methods, neural network-based methods, and template-based methods and focus on analyzing the SVM methods' principles and theories. |
| 12:40 pm | Thomas Torbert | Effectiveness and Fairness of YouTube's AI | Recommendation Systems are a vital part of our lives. It has been shown that 92% of adults rely on a recommendation system when seeking information about a topic.  As such, it would be a critical failure if our recommendation systems did not give accurate and relevant information.  To ensure the success of our recommendation systems, I searched for both the inner workings of our systems and the fairness of our systems.  As a result, I found that collaborative filtering and matrix factorization are both key factors in recommending videos on YouTube, and that most recommendation are out of the hands of humans.  This has the possibility of recommending videos that have sub-par ethical implications or may support an agenda.  Its up to the viewers of the platform to make informed decisions about their results, and filter through videos of unwanted moral or social standing. |
| 1:00 pm | Peng Ziong | How to Recommend in a Computer Science and Mathematical Way? | Recommendations have become a popular way of getting different opinions from people on things, i.e., movies, consumer products, dating, etc. Let us ask ourselves, can we make an automated system that can help with this issue? Recommendation systems have become the fore front of giving recommendations to people. These systems can utilize mathematical techniques/machine learning algorithms, such as matrix factorization, to give recommendations. The techniques of these mathematical models/machine learning techniques are giving these recommendation systems its capabilities to help society have more options. With this, recommendation systems are improving and starting to gain attraction from businesses to ordinary people. |
| 1:20 pm | DeAndré Bethell | Deep Neural Network-based IDS | Attackers adopt contemporary mechanisms and methodologies to commit cybercrime. When consumers pay no attention to computer security of devices and potential cyber hackings, network-based IDS systems footrace a plethora of cybercriminals in attempt to prevent cybercrime. This paper presents a survey of methods for machine learning algorithms further discussed later and unravels Network IDS systems' mechanisms employed for preventative network-based intrusion detection models. Open Sourced network companies assist in evaluating the machine learning mechanism’s ongoing plans incorporating network-based information detection systems (IDS) and their methodologies prevalence/success rate in preserving cybersecurity. |
| 1:40 pm | Gregory Drayton | teSn g expa:o gim yt omohhprT Ctpye i aarhdcdMrC (Cryptography: Math and Science Mixed Together) | To keep our information secure, networks rely of cryptography to keep information encrypted in a way that makes it difficult for an adversary to decipher if they manage to intercept information between networks. However, adversaries know how information is encrypted, and for cryptography to remain effective, it must continually evolve to make sure adversaries still cannot decipher codes. This presentation will begin by giving a brief explanation of the history of cryptography. It will then explain the basic principles of modern cryptography and will explain what the future trend for cryptography will be. What this presentation finds is that as passwords are becoming more outdated as safeguards, most encrypted information will be of fingerprints, facial recognition, DNA, etc. Because these are not guessable for an adversary, the deciphering of cryptography will be the most feasible way of hacking in the future, making cryptography more important in the coming future. |
| 2:00 pm | Tyreese Robinson | Securing the Future | Virtually everyone who uses the internet today is exposed to a security threat. Whether it be Zoom, Facebook, Gmail, or Angry Birds, we rely on applications for our daily lives. These applications often pose security risks to themselves and their users, due to the vast majority of them containing security vulnerabilities within their code. SQL is a programming language used to manage the databases for a majority of organizations today. Consequently, these applications are then prone to millions of cybercriminals, attempting to exploit these vulnerabilities within the code and extract sensitive data. This presentation will provide a brief overview of SQL, some of the common attacks performed against it, a look into why the most popular database manager is as vulnerable as it is today and how that can be changed. |
| 2:20 pm | Gavin Wollenberg | Don't Plug that in | In 2011, the Department of Homeland Security preformed a hacking experiment on their employees. USB sticks were dropped in the parking lot and the surrounding area. A total of 60% of the devices were plugged into a government computer. Regardless of how secure a firewall or webserver is, people will always be the weakest link in security. Most are not informed enough on how damaging USBs can be, especially when utilizing HID hardware. Everyone should have a basic understanding of USB attacks, as they can be a key part in social engineering. This paper aims to inform the reader on how bad USBs, specifically the name brand ‘USB rubber ducky’, can inflict so much damage. The result is an easy way to gather information. All a hacker would need is the USB device and a creative mind. The contents of this paper are intended for educational purposes only. We cannot be held liable for any damage caused. |


## Thursday, February 18, 5 - 8 pm

| **Time** | **Speaker** | **Title** | **Abstract** |
| -------- | ----------- | --------- | ------------ |
| 5:00 pm | Ashton Andrews | Malware and its Mitigation | Between the mid 80’s and early 2000’s, the state of technology and viruses were minuscule. Thus, there was not much of a cyber-threat being posed. However, with the advancement of technology comes the advancement of malware and other forms of exploitation. Malicious Software, also known as Malware, can be devastating to our hardware, and as a result, many people have spent years formulating ways to mitigate the spread of Malware. It is for this reason I have synthesized the following information. In this paper, I discuss the history and background of Malware and its Mitigation, and dive deeper into its technical aspects.  This paper will give insight on the research done for Malware and its Mitigation and more specifically, through Deep Neural Networks and Deep Learning.|
| 5:20 pm | Justin Brakob | Network Intrusion Detection Systems: How Security Admins are Winning the Armsrace Against Hackers | Every business and organization relies heavily on their networks to store data, communicate, access the internet, transfer money, and many other sensitive things.  Hackers seek to enter into systems illicitly and capture that data.  Network Intrusion Detection and Intrusion Prevention Systems counteract these bad actors.  These systems run on the network and analyze traffic to detect incoming attacks.  Although security is a continually evolving field, network administrators can successfully block almost every malicious entry.  Advancements in Intrusion Prevention technologies will continue to give administrators the advantage over attackers for years to come. |
| 5:40 pm | Andrew Breyen | Phishing: How to Catch the Phish before you get hooked | Phishing is an attack involving messaging to have individuals provide information including passwords, credit card details and more.  Phishing is a relevant issue to many large institutions as well as everyday users. ProofPoint found that 83% of companies experienced phishing, which causes financial burden, over $500 million. It is crucial that detection and mitigation techniques be assessed. Phishing classifiers use several methods to detect malicious messages. It is a challenge to know how the different classifiers perform and why it is important that they are used. Several models are analyzed for effectiveness. These models include a traditional deep learning model, a recurrent neural network, the entropy of non-alphanumeric characters, as well as how to break these classifiers. The random forest classifier is 92.7% effective, and mitigation techniques can break in. Phishing is not going away. We must evolve how we detect it to better protect us from this growing threat. |
| 6:00 pm | Zachary Heinen | Preventing attacks before deployment | Development is growing faster than security. This leads to security professionals being overworked and having huge waiting lists to approve programs for deployment. To save time and money, static analyzers have been developed to find security vulnerabilities. Static analyzers cannot be used alone because of the many false positives usually found, but they can narrow down the code security professionals need to analyze. Static analyzers are the tools that will help keep security on pace with development. |
| 6:20 pm | Nathan Drees | Human Like Responses | As we move into the age of Artificial intelligence (AI) and robots we will start to see these two things converge. Socially Assistive Robotics (SAR) will bring elderly care to different places than it is today.  One thing that we all do is age and will have these kinds of technology in our future. One aspect of these technologies will be their ability to communicate with us; to have human-like conversations with us. One way we have started having this ability is thorough chatbots. How can they become quicker at responding and being closer to human response times? One way is having the ability to quickly access data in large databases. Although the AI does not have the capability of maintaining meaningful conversations we are still able to have coherent conversations without problem. This kind of technology will have an impact on how we care for our elderly in our society and the way we treat them. |
| 6:40 pm | Ryan Graham | 'Hey Google, Nevermind': NLU in VUIs | Voice User Interfaces (VUI) are becoming increasingly popular in today’s technology, and they have a complex task of understanding human language.They must do this right and enable humans to speak naturally. Today’s VUIs are hard to use because they often misunderstand. This stems from the language model they use to contextualize speech. Poorly trained VUIs are frustrating and cause users to utilize them less over time. In this paper I analyze the current state-of-art language model and its predecessors through comparing the performance in their natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Results show state-of-the-art permutation modeling captures word context the best through analyzing the probabilities of each word appearing after each other. I conclude with a discussion on the gaps filled in language models today and how a computer may be able to embed tonal inflections in words to further create better models.  |
| 7:00 pm | Andrew Heroux | Seeing with your Ears | A blind person can walk through their house with little worry of running into things or breaking something. By learning where things are, they move around with ease. In a foreign public space this is not the case. This can be helped by telling them where things are. ASYSST can turn a floor plan into a room description. Listening to it, a blind person can walk around with the comfort of being home. |
| 7:20 pm | Vincent Kahlhamer | The Art of Self-Driving Cars | With thousands of car crashes happening every single day, we need to develop a way to make our roads safer and reduce the number of crashes. Self-driving cars could be the answer to this problem but they have to be better than humans to succeed. The technology behind what makes a car self-driving is starting to get really good. From the cameras to the ethics, the self-driving car has a lot to offer for everyone. |
| 7:40 pm | Tianyu (Dover) Zou | INSIDE: VOICE RECOGNITION | Voice recognition has been developed for more than half a century, and there is an increasing demand for its performance. Therefore, it is essential for it always produces the correct results. I investigate how the latest technology, the the-end-to-end model, works in voice recognition to predict this field's future trend. For this purpose, I read technical papers from experts to gain deep insight from how sound is read to the end-to-end model. My findings predict the end-to-end strategy will play a more important role in voice recognition. And I concluded that traditional methods would be faded away at some point because of the rise of the end-to-end model. |
