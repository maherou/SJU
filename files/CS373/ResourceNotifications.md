## Notifications: Automated Ways to Find New Resources

### Introduction
Many online services scan the available literature for newly-published content.  You can take advantage of these services to be notified of new content as it becomes available.  Below are some of the popular services that can keep you informed about any topic of interest.

### Google Scholar

You can set up Google Scholar notifications for new publications in your areas of interest by following these steps:

#### Option 1: Follow a Topic
1.	Go to [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com).
2.	In the search bar, enter keywords related to your area of interest (e.g., “high-performance computing”, “MPI communication patterns”).
3.	On the search results page, look for the “Create alert” option (usually on the left sidebar).
4.	Click “Create alert” and enter your email address.
5.	Adjust the number of results per alert (optional).
6.	Click “Create Alert”—you’ll now receive email updates when new papers matching your search appear.

#### Option 2: Follow a Specific Author

If you want updates from specific researchers:
1.	Search for the author’s name in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com).
2.	Click on their profile (if they have one).
3.	Look for the “Follow” button and select “New articles.”
4.	Enter your email and confirm the subscription.

#### Option 3: Follow Citations of a Paper

If you’re interested in new papers citing a specific work:
1.	Find the paper in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com).
2.	Click “Cited by [number]” under the paper.
3.	On the resulting page, click “Create alert” to get notified of new citing papers.

This setup ensures you stay updated on new research without having to check manually. 

### Other services
Besides Google Scholar, several other services provide research notifications with access to different types of resources, including journals, preprints, and technical reports. Here are some good alternatives:

1. Semantic Scholar
	-	Website: [https://www.semanticscholar.org](https://www.semanticscholar.org)
	-	Uses AI to provide personalized recommendations.
	-	Allows you to set up alerts for new research papers based on keywords, authors, or citations.
	-	Covers both journal articles and preprints (e.g., arXiv, bioRxiv).

2. ResearchGate
	-	Website: [https://www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net)
	-	Focuses on academic networking.
	-	Provides notifications for new papers from researchers you follow.
	-	Sends updates on discussions and new citations of your work.

3. arXiv Digest
	-	Website: [https://arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org)
	-	Covers preprints in computer science, physics, and related fields.
	-	You can set up custom email alerts for specific topics or categories (e.g., “Machine Learning” or “Computational Science”).
	-	ArXiv Sanity Preserver (https://www.arxiv-sanity.com/) also provides personalized feeds.

4. IEEE Xplore Alerts
	-	Website: [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org)
	-	Best for engineering, computing, and technology fields.
	-	Allows you to set up email alerts for new papers in specific IEEE journals/conferences.

Each of these services has a different focus and resource set, so using multiple can give a broader view of new research. Google Scholar is great for general academic search, but combining it with Semantic Scholar, arXiv, or IEEE Xplore (if in HPC/AI) can be more effective.
