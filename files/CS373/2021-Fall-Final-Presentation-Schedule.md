### Session 1: 10:00 am - 1:00 pm

| **Time** | **Speaker** | **Title** | **Abstract** |
| -------- | ----------- | --------- | ------------ |
| 10:00 am | Thomas de St Aubin | Graph Data Bases and Identity Theft | This presentation focuses on the differences of relational databases and graph databases, and how graph databases are better suited for identifying identity theft. The graph database in focus is neo4j, as this provides a specific example to be related to. When comparing the two databases, structure is the key component when deciding which would be better suited for identity theft prediction. Graph databases are deemed the better of the two databases when deciding which is better suited for catching identity theft.  |
| 10:20 am | Carter Huberty| HCI Is Getting HARI|Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has come to a halt. Augmented Reality (AR) is stepping in making it Human-Augmented Reality Interaction (HARI). We researched the history of HCI and everything brought us to AR. Because of this, we strove to learn AR. We broke down the current algorithms used in AR. ORB-SLAM is the current leading algorithm for AR. ORB is made up of two algorithms known as FAST and BRIEF. FAST finds the keypoints of an object or image and BRIEF creates feature descriptors thus matching keypoints. SLAM is the algorithm that tracks users’ position in an environment. Improving these algorithms will improve the user experience thus improving HARI. We end with mathematical models showing the future of AR depending on whether challenges are met. |

| 11:20 am | Patrick Hesse | How to Reproduce Results | Computational results must be trustworthy to hold scientific merit. As hardware and software evolve, results that were considered reproducible can no longer be obtained. With some extra effort, this problem can be avoided. Taking inspiration from software development, the same DevOps tools that are used to improve the quality of a software project can be applied to research papers to improve reproducibility. After integrating DevOps tools into a variety of computational workflows, our experience shows that these tools move the burden of executing common ad-hoc tasks from the human to the machine, therefore minimizing human error that could degrade the trustworthiness of computational results. Specifying every dependency as code allows researchers to capture the entire state of a computational workflow and share this state to other researchers who want to validate the findings of a paper. |
| 11:40 am | Connor Boyer| Using VR Vibrations to Replicate Mirror-touch Synesthesia | Virtual Reality (VR) has become a widely successful piece of technology with many more users per year joining in.  In recent years force and touch feedback, also known as vibrotactile feedback, is becoming more and more prevalent in VR to emphasize realism.  Mirror-touch synesthesia (MTS) (commonly associated with the confusion of distinct senses) is something that affects a small proportion of the population.  The proposal is by using VR, specifically by using the controller haptics to see if you can replicate or cause a physical sensation of MTS for those that may not have it.  By using Unreal Engine, the approach is using different iterations of vibration to see where the line of cognition by vibrotactile feedback and MTS.  A major application of this work is finding a point where recognition can change based on the amount of vibrotactile feedback, to replicate MTS.  Another impact includes medical diagnosis with more evaluation for individuals who may believe they experience MTS.|
| 12:00 pm | Peyton Maahs| Building a Cryptocurrency |Cryptocurrencies have been revolutionizing the financial markets across the world, however few people understand how they work and even fewer know how to build their own. The talk is going through the various stages of design and tools that are used to build a cryptocurrency on the ethereum blockchain. From the starting blocks of understanding blockchain technology to launching a cryptocurrency on several trading apps, coding a cryptocurrency blockchain is a different experience from anything in computer science. |
| 12:20 pm | Malik Harper| Lenses of UX: Personas and Journey Maps | Introducing User Experience as an important concept used in product design . Followed by Personas and Journey Maps are part of the design process.  Personas and Journey Maps and how they influence product design. Following understanding Personas and Journey Maps as some techniques of User Experience with a demonstration of Journey Mapping. Ending with key points on the User Experience, Personas, and Journey Maps. |
| 12:40 pm | Kayli Thulin| A comprehensive review of Hadoop|The term 'Big Data' narrates techniques to capture, store, distribute, manage and analyze data sets with different structures. Big data can be structured, unstructured or semi-structured, resulting in normal conventional data management methods to be incapable of processing. In order to process these large amounts of data in an efficient and inexpensive way, parallelism is used. Hadoop started as a Google File System paper titled, “MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters” published in 2003. This led to the development of the Apache Nutch, an open-source web crawler, which later was factored into what the foundation of Hadoop is in 2006. Presently Hadoop now has a collection of open-source software utilities that manages big data storage in a distributed way and processes it parallelly. It is designed to scale up from a single server to thousands of machines, with a very high degree of fault tolerance.|

| 2:30 pm | Channa Kalsow| Tapping Into a Different Kind of Forest| Machine learning has become a vital field in computing. Decision trees are one of the most mature and accessible parts of machine learning. Decision trees have been successfully used for data classification since 1986 but they struggle to classify data outside of the training set used to create them. This is due to the inherently biased nature of decision trees. By building a random forest, the issue of bias can be solved by leveraging it as a strength. While random forests are more complex and slower than decision trees, they are the better classifier because they classify a variety of data accurately. Therefore, random forests should be used instead of decision trees whenever possible. |
| 2:50 pm | Alex Morales-Garcia| Recidivism Predictions: A Harm or Benefit?  | Prediction algorithms influence multiple aspects of life. The Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS), a black-box model, is currently used in states such as New York, Wisconsin, and Florida to predict recidivism. The purpose of this paper breaks down the ethical, technical and social components of COMPAS. In particular, it will analyze whether COMPAS breaks levels of fairness based on the Florida, Broward County 2013-2014 dataset. Results reflect COMPAS’s lack of fairness and interpretability between different groups of people through calibration, equalized odds, and disparate impact. This discovery warrants necessity for evaluation and interpretability in recidivism algorithms. This paper recommends the transition of interpretable systems and future steps for recidivism algorithms. In conclusion, this paper does not intend to dismiss the use of Recidivism algorithm, but rather re-examine to create ethical and fair recidivism predictions.|

| 3:30 pm | Ruby Geng| Security and Authentication in IoT Networks| IoT devices allows for the hyper specialization of machines, dividing complex physical world environments into independent, flexible variables. Together the IoT network allows for fully automated systems that seamlessly merge the digital and physical world. However, the increase in numbers of connected devices to a network pose a challenge to device management and authenticating device identities. Through surveying available field data, I’ve analyzed security risks in the networking layer of IoT systems and authentication schemes that can be applied to IoT devices. I’ve discovered that IoT devices work best with a lightweight centralized authentication models that are relatively less computationally intensive. Hardware based authentication combined with multi factor verification when first introducing a device to the network appears to be a promising approach to authentication in IoT systems. |
| 3:50 pm | Runqi Hu| Smart Home and Network security| With the continuous development of Internet of Things applications, a large number of mobile terminal devices participate in service computing, and the traditional cloud computing model has been unable to meet the data generation speed of network edge devices. Edge computing model emerges at the historic moment and has become a research hotspot in recent years. This paper introduces the concept of edge computing and the reference model of edge computing in Internet of Things, analyzes and summarizes the attacks on edge devices, and summarizes the main research achievements of algorithm security technology in edge computing. It also studies the legal and moral construction of Internet of Things devices for user privacy protection in the current society. The future application of quantum computer technology in edge devices is discussed, and some suggestions on edge computing security technology are put forward.|
| 4:10 pm | Riley Chapman | Modern Machine learning algorithms: Are Support Vector Machines still useful?| Machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), can help you make more efficient and effective decisions. Despite almost being 3 decades old. I seek to understand why SVM are still one of the most widely used classification models today. First, I will demonstrate how SVM find the optimal decision boundary for linearly separable data. For simplicity, I chose to create a data set using students' GPA & MCAT scores to predict if they will get into Medical school. Then, I will show how kernel functions allow SVM to make predictions for non-linearly separable data. To illustrate these concepts, I utilized Python libraries SciKit learn, Pandas, Numpy, and matplotlib. Despite being the oldest machine learning model, my findings suggest that SVM are still valuable because of their ability to adapt to the data set that you are working with. Each unique kernel function allows you to adjust and improve the results. I conclude the paper with a discussion on the future of SVM. |
