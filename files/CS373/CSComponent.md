## Computer Science Requirements for Your Project

### Your Project Must Have a Significant Computer Science Component
The basic test for the success of your project is: _Does it require your computer science background to understand and do the work?_

### Ways to test this requirement for sufficiency
1. Are you exploring sophisticated algorithms (sufficient)?
1. Are you exploring detailed data management approaches (sufficient)? 
1. Are you exploring advanced software architecture and design (sufficient)?
1. Does my content sound like a marketing brochure (not sufficient)?
1. Do I cover many concepts at a very high level (not sufficient)?

### Ways to test this requirement for achievability
1. Can I develop a prototype or demostrate the concepts of my project?
1. Would a detailed description of my project be a chapter in a thesis (achievable) or a full thesis (non achievable)?

### Other Resources
1. The [Course Handbook](./CSCI373CourseHandbookLatestEdition.pdf) contains a lot of guidance on selecting a good topic and making your project successful. Consult the handbook regularly.
1. Review [papers from previous students](./SamplePapers/SOTFPaperList.md).
