| 10:15 | Cameron Bjork |Security Frameworks in Cloud Computing | This presentation explores two approaches for addressing security challenges within cloud computing: dynamic changes to Virtual Machines (VMs) and secure orchestration of containers. The Security Service Level Agreement-Moving Target Defense framework provides a way to dynamically change VMs used by cloud applications by determining admissible configurations that respect a given Security SLA. Additionally, the Secure Container Orchestration (SCO) framework ensures that only trusted code runs inside the enclave and that the code has not been modified since it was signed. As cloud-native technologies continue to grow, looking back at frameworks such as the SCO and SLA-MTD and how they address security of the application from the cloud service provider will be increasingly important for the future development of security in cloud applications.|
