### Session 1: 10:30 am - 12:45 pm, Wednesday, December 14

| **Time** | **Speaker** | **Title** | **Abstract** |
| -------- | ----------- | --------- | ------------ |
| 10:30 | Eli Weiss |Silica Glass Long Term Data Storage | The need for long term cloud data storage is ever growing.  Keeping up with all this information requires innovation.  There needs to be a more efficient way of storing and accessing it over long periods of time.  One approach is using a laser to scribe information in the bulk of silica glass, layering information, creating a dense pattern of information.  This method can currently achieve over 7TB of information on a piece of glass the size of a CD.  With further development, glass data storage might show superior to other methods of cold data storage in the cloud.|
| 10:45 | Jack Clisham| In the Ballpark: How Sabermetrics Make Baseball More Predictable| Sabermetric analysis has always been a part of baseball's history, but has recently exploded in popularity in almost every facet. There are several methods used to harness them such as Markov chains. With the acceleration of sabermetrics and technology, people in baseball must stay on top of changes similar to those in tech industries. |
| 11:00 | Kristiana Anderson |The Use of Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict Crop Yield |By 2050 the global population is expected to increase by more than one billion people. Unless the global crop yield is dramatically increased, food security will continue to decline. Simultaneously, the escalating effects of climate change will continue to disrupt agriculture. To aid in crop production, machine learning algorithms can be used to predict and  increase crop yield. This paper will analyze the machine learning algorithms used to predict crop yield as well as compare the practicality of each algorithm. The algorithms discussed include Convolutional Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest Classifiers, and Linear Regression. These machine learning algorithms can improve farmers’ understandings of their crops leading to better resource allocation and thus better budgets. Due to the usefulness of these algorithms, machine learning will continue to spread throughout agriculture, aiding farmers in their quest to more efficiently produce crops. |
| 11:15 | Mia Sabin |How Algorithms are Used to Assist with Pretrial Releases |Within the criminal justice system, crime patterns are prevalent. Having the ability to detect crime patterns to predict future crimes, will benefit both the community and court system. Pretrial release decisions are made daily by court judges on defendants who want to await their trial out of custody. Finding the most effective, efficient way to review pretrial release requests is crucial for the sake of public safety and defendant flight risk. The ID3 and C4.5 algorithms use past data sets to create decision trees, which are then used to assist in making pretrial release decisions. There are advantages and disadvantages to both algorithms, but ultimately the C4.5 is more efficient when analyzing different values. This approach helps predict criminal behavior and speed up the judges review process. Utilizing these algorithms will help the court system follow trends from past data sets and make the best pretrial release decision for everyone involved. |
| 11:30 | Jo Nemanich|Audio-Visual Deepfakes: The Risks and Preventative Measures | With the continuous improvement in deepfake media, audio-visual deepfakes pose a great risk to personal security and information. To gain a greater understanding of the potential risks for personal protection, this research first gained an understanding of deepfake creation and potential uses. Following this, cases of malicious deepfake use was explored, as well as legal implications. Measures such as the R.E.A.L. framework were found for personal protection. Searching through current and potential legal policies provided a range of protective measures and legal options for the average individual and potential victim. Findings of cases such as the Dr. Jordan Peterson case and college student Noelle Martin provided proof of potential devastating risks for victims of malicious deepfake media. This paper concludes with an emphasis on knowledge of risks and legal solutions to assist in managing and preventing future victimization. |
| 11:45 | Aretha McDonald |Intro to Computational Drug Discovery | In drug discovery, bioinformatics (the application of computation and analysis to capture and interpret biological data) and other computer-aided methods play a major role in filtering large compound libraries into smaller sets of data, conducting exploratory analyses, and more! My presentation will promote computational drug discovery as an effective strategy for accelerating and economizing the drug discovery and development process.|
| 12:00 | Logan Woods | Analysis of Current Day NFL Advanced Statistics|As statistics grow in the NFL, metrics are used to help develop and improve the sport of football. Many current aspects of the game are analyzed; however, the effectiveness of these models has often been questioned. By surveying the NFL’s Big Data Bowl, a yearly analytic competition, the excellence and usefulness of models in football is prominent. In observing and learning from these models, all aspects of football can be examined and improved upon. Each model follows a strict algorithm to provide insight on individual performance, team performance, or decision making among coaches. After careful inspection of these models, it can be predicted the way in which the game will change in all aspects. The effectiveness and use of these models is variable, but change is evident in some form or another.  |
| 12:15 | Chinou Thao | The next Eyes of Security| Organizations traditionally relied on security guards to protect the security of their premises. However, this approach has limitations such as security guards not being able to be present in two places at once, not being available 24/7, and security guards running the risk of overlooking an issue. With the help of computer vision, security systems will not only eliminate these limitations but help in detecting and actively preventing crimes. In this paper, we took a closer look at how computer vision works with the help of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and how additional algorithms have helped improve the accuracy rate of detection and prevention. As computer vision continues to improve and be implemented in security and monitoring systems, human error in security will be a thing of the past. Computer vision will be the next evolutional step in terms of security systems. Although evolutionary, computer vision will also raise a lot of ethical concerns and privacy issues.|
| 12:30 | Ian Wilson | How happy is your 401k?: Types of sentiment based algorithmic trading|Analyzing sentiment related to financial markets helps investors gain an understanding of the outlook toward a given security. Algorithmic trading is ubiquitous, but a generally accepted, effective implementation remains unsolved. Using sentiment data, assessment of future financial security movement is possible. By analyzing multiple papers from the field of algorithmic trading, the benefits and drawbacks of different sources of sentiment were assessed. News sentiment is effective because of its quality, but ineffective regarding its quantity, timeliness, and journalism themes. Social media sentiment can be effective due to its size and speed of release with the drawback of a significant data filtering requirement. The choice between the two is dependent on the goal of the strategy. For a long-term trading strategy, news sentiment is good because the drawback of timeliness will not be detrimental. For fast, short-term trading strategies, social media sentiment is a better option. |

### Session 2: 1:15 - 3:30, Wednesday, December 14

| **Time** | **Speaker** | **Title** | **Abstract** |
| -------- | ----------- | --------- | ------------ |
| 1:15 | Reese Marek | Seeing through the Cloud| Cloud computing is the use of the internet to run certain applications and services. A cloud computing platform manages and provides certain services to a user to allow them to be more efficient and pay for what they use. Few of the services offered by cloud providers are Software as a service, Platforms as a service, and Infrastructure as a service. Each service has a level of control that the company has over the infrastructure, meaning companies can choose how much of the infrastructure they want to worry about. Allowing providers to manage and maintain infrastructures, opens the door for companies to get more work done and not have to worry about provision their infrastructure. This presentation will go over the pros and cons of both a cloud environment and a on premise infrastructure while providing a demonstration setting up a cloud database. In the end there will be a future trend of what I expect the cloud to be like in coming years. |
| 1:30 | Luke McElroy |Computer Vision in Baseball: The Evolution of Statcast |Computer vision is being used in sports to gain competitive advantages and enhance fan experiences. Major League Baseball is incorporating new computer vision technologies to its Statcast system with the goal of bringing more analytical data to the game. This paper analyzes the new technologies brought in, how they obtain data through cameras and algorithms, and what the data is being used for. Technical aspects discussed include the creation of point clouds by using the ICP algorithm, Kalman filtering, and position tracking using cameras. Due to the multitude of new data brought it with these techniques, players are getting much better and competitiveness is rising. To conclude this paper, we will look specifically at how pitchers are using this data to get better and how Major League Baseball is already making changes to balance the effects.  |
| 1:45 | Owen Dauk |Facial Expression Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks | Facial expressions are a huge part of the non-verbal human language and are very important identifiers in showing emotions. Being able to analyze these expressions helps to create an understanding of human behavior. Some applications include, dynamic analysis, pattern recognition, interpersonal interaction, and mental health monitoring. Facial expression recognition is accomplished with computer vision using machine learning techniques. The most common technique performed is done using neural networks, specifically convolutional neural networks. Convolutional neural networks are commonly used because the built-in convolutional layer reduces the dimensionality of images without losing its information. Within this presentation, facial expression recognition using convolutional neural networks will be introduced and the process explained. In addition, how this technology is applied in real life situations, the challenges faced, and future trends of the technology will be presented. |
| 2:00 | K'Gia Turnquest |Machine Learning within the Health Care Industry | One of the leading determinants of a country’s overall economic success can be attributed to its healthcare industry. This industry is not only vital for providing numerous jobs, but it is a necessity for the maintenance of people’s lives. It is through the use of machine learning on large datasets that many researchers and medical practitioners are able to make diagnoses and new inventions. Therefore, for this presentation, I will be looking at the use of machine learning algorithms within the Health Care Industry. The algorithms used were Decision Tree, Logistic Regression and Neural Networks which were applied to a dataset in order to evaluate their performance. Hyper-parameter tuning was a technique used to get the most accurate model. Overall, Decision Tree was found to be the top performer. Hence, decision trees may be used more often in the health care industry when working with categorical data that requires a binary outcome.|
| 2:15 | Arik Rorie | Seeing Through The Chaos| Computer Vision has the potential to directly impact the way we view sports, especially the game of Football. There are several steps that must be implanted and built on each other such as Image classification and Object Tracking. Only after establishing these points do, we see the combination of sports and technology. This paper breaks down how Computer Vision on the surface and then dives deeper into each process. At the end, there is the application of how Computer Vision and football can coexist. |
| 2:30 | Hongtao Wang | A first look at the object detection algorithm|The area of object detection has been developed for more than twenty years, from the early traditional methods to today's deep learning methods. Although object detection is widely used in robot navigation, surveillance, and many other fields, the general public's knowledge of its algorithms is still rudimentary. This presentation will give a systematic introduction to the development of the Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN) series, the representative of the object detection field, and demonstrate its latest Mask R-CNN algorithm, aiming to build a preliminary knowledge framework for the audience as well as an initial understanding of the technology stack related to object detection and its future development trend. This presentation will stimulate the audience to think critically about object detection and its opportunities and challenges. |
| 2:45 | Wenchy Dutreuil |Framing the Picture |Frames are an  expressive and adaptable form of knowledge representation that can be used for automatic reasoning. This paper begins by describing what knowledge representation and reasoning is. Then proceeds to explain that a Frame is a data structure used in knowledge representation and reasoning. Frames are commonly used in knowledge-based expert systems; so, the paper continues by exploring a case study on the use of frames in a simplified expert system. Currently experts systems are used for decision support, but their power and accuracy has led me to believe that they will begin to play a primary role in decision making. |
| 3:00 | Alexandria Watkins | Mitigating Bias in AI and ML| Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning has impacted how people function in society over time. There are countless algorithms that aid in our decision making, and decisions made about us. However, these algorithms have been proven to show bias and discrimination against certain groups of people or populations who are typically marginalized. Hence, why I will be researching various strategies needed to remove biases from algorithms, and create new technologies that support all people. I analyzed biased datasets, and created models to decipher where bias began, and what sensitive features contributed to bias. I’ve found that using various definitions of fairness was helpful in reducing bias in AI and ML systems.Researching bias in AI and ML systems is a complex task, but a necessary protocol that computer scientists should consider to create equitable technologies in the future. |
| 3:15 | Joe Sebenaler  |High-Frequency Trading: A Look Inside the Fast-Paced World of Finance | High-frequency trading (HFT) is a way of using computers to trade stocks and other securities at very high speeds. It uses complex algorithms and specialized programs to make many trades in a short amount of time. The goal is to make small profits on each trade that add up to significant gains. HFT has become more popular among financial institutions because it allows them to react quickly to market changes. However, some people are concerned about its potential to harm markets and other investors.|
