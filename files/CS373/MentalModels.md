## Introduction to Developing and Using Mental Models

### What is a Mental Model?
A mental model is a collection of **_entities_** and the **_relationships_** between those entities.  A mental model helps us understand systems, communities and other environments with dynamic behavior.  A good mental model is typically accurate but not too precise, exposing important characteristics that influenced or are impacted by the dynamics of the environment.

### Why is a Mental Model Important?
When we work in technical fields, we often acquire implicit mental models that we use to understand, gain insight, and make decisions.  Making these mental models explicit, by building diagrams or other visual constructs, we can name, explore, and refine the entities and relationships of our mental models.

A documented mental model allows us to communicate our thoughts with others, further refine our ideas, and gain insight into future trends.  One or more documented mental models provide the foundation for decision making and planning for the future.
