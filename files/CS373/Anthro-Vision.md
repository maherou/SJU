### Book
[Anthro-Vision: A New Way to See in Business](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Anthro-Vision/Gillian-Tett/9781982140960) by [Gillian Tett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillian_Tett).

### Discussion Guidelines
- Read the material before coming to class.  You won't be quizzed on it, but do it because it is the right thing to do.
- Discussions will first occur in small groups:
  - Create a shared Google Doc using the template from from [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vH8l9rZ64IT7irxYsmvnAoHzGQ5cE0Hd?usp=sharing).
  - As discussion occurs, respect and try to understand all comments made.
  - During the discussion, take notes about key ideas that emerge.  
  - For each key idea, try to identify an example that illustrates the idea.
  - Make sure that everyone has a chance to speak.
  - Make sure each person can see everyone else.
  - Develop a question that you can ask of other teams.
  - Designate a person to speak on behalf of the group to summarize discussion using your group notes.
- Summary discussion will occur with the whole class.
  - Designated speaker for each small group will synthesis group points.
  - Other team members may bring up or clarify group ideas.
