### Session 1: 2:00 - 3:15 pm

| **Time** | **Speaker** | **Title** | **Abstract** |
| -------- | ----------- | --------- | ------------ |
| 2:00 pm  | Alec Chamberlain | | |
| 2:15 pm  | Will Magarian|Reeling in Phish: Using Random Forests to Catch Cyber Threats |Phishing attacks exploit human vulnerabilities to steal sensitive information, posing significant risks to individuals and organizations. Traditional detection methods struggle to adapt to evolving tactics, necessitating more robust solutions. This paper explores phishing detection using machine learning, focusing on Random Forests, which leverage decision trees to identify patterns in email data. By training on labeled datasets and extracting key features like metadata and content, Random Forests outperformed traditional techniques like Logistic Regression, achieving high accuracy with a false positive rate under 2%. The study emphasizes the value of integrating Random Forests into hybrid systems and suggests future advancements in feature selection and explainable AI to improve detection against evolving cyber threats. These findings highlight the potential for scalable and adaptive phishing defense systems. |
| 2:30 pm  | CJ Mahn | | |
| 2:45 pm  | Maria Nathe |SQL Injection Attacks: Understanding, Preventing, and Mitigating | SQL Injection (SQLi) remains a critical threat to web application security. Despite advancements in cybersecurity, SQLi continues to exploit vulnerabilities, compromising sensitive data and system integrity. This paper investigates the evolution of SQLi attacks, including sophisticated methods such as Blind SQLi, Union-Based SQLi, and Out-of-Band SQLi. Advanced detection and mitigation approaches are analyzed, with a focus on machine learning-based intrusion detection systems, parameterized queries, and secure architectural practices. Results indicate that while traditional defenses such as Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) mitigate classic attacks, emerging technologies like Zero Trust Architecture and quantum-resistant encryption are essential for addressing future challenges. This comprehensive study highlights the enduring relevance of SQLi, providing actionable insights into prevention strategies and the need for continuous innovation in cybersecurity defenses.|

### Session 2: 3:30 - 4:45 pm

| **Time** | **Speaker** | **Title** | **Abstract** |
| -------- | ----------- | --------- | ------------ |
| 3:30 pm  | Abbi Pexa | | |
| 3:45 pm  | Tyler Pohlman |Data Imputation Using Machine Learning Techniques |Data quality is essential for effective decision-making, yet missing data can compromise this goal. This study evaluates Missforest, a machine learning algorithm based on random forests, for imputing missing values under the Missing at Random (MAR) mechanism. Using metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Percent Bias (PB), Missforest's performance was compared to simple mean imputation methods. Results show that mean imputation introduces significant bias, suggesting insufficiency in maintaining feature relationships. Missforest provides superior accuracy and preserves data integrity. Additionally, trends such as neural network-driven approaches like Generative Adversarial Imputation Networks (GAIN) highlight advancements in handling complex data gaps. This work reinforces machine learning's role in enhancing data preprocessing and analytics. |
| 4:00 pm  | Evan Quinn |The Present and Future of Race Strategy in F1 | Formula 1 (F1), the pinnacle of motorsport, relies on optimizing race strategies to achieve victory in a millisecond-sensitive competition. Complex race conditions, advancing technologies, and sustainability goals demand innovative solutions. Challenges include managing variables like tire degradation, pit stop efficiency, and weather. While current methods struggle with real-time adaptability, this presentation looks at how those problems can be solved in the near future. This work examines current strategy solutions by using regression analysis for tire management and outlier detection for data refinement, while also exploring future technology like machine learning for real-time analytics and emerging tools like autonomous pit crews and drivers, hydrogen power, and weather-responsive AI, just to name a few.|
| 4:15 pm  | Daniel Schmitz | Verifying in a post quantum age |With the post quantum age quickly approaching, we need a new way to verify and trust the information and files we receive. Old ways are quickly becoming compromised. I will demonstrate a simple implementation of dilithium in Python. |
| 4:30 pm  | Josefa Zarate Dolores |Learning to See: How CNNs Transform Visual Data |Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) revolutionize how computers process visual data by mimicking the human visual system. This talk explores the core processes behind CNNs, including feature extraction, training, and classification, and their application in fields like medical imaging and autonomous vehicles. By analyzing current trends, I illustrate how CNNs excel in image recognition and predict their future evolution, focusing on integration with generative AI. This presentation aims to inform and inspire with insights into CNN advancements shaping the future of AI-driven vision technology. |
