**Title: A Perspective on Continued Learning in the Software Industry**

**Abstract**

Learning doesn't end after graduation; one of the core skills in the computer science / software engineering field is bringing together new knowledge with foundations and first principles to solve key problems that our world needs to be solved. Ryan has been working at Google as a Software Engineer for 5.5 years. He has worked on a handful of software products across the legal and education spaces and is now a technical lead on Google Classroom. He'll be sharing his experience learning new ideas and technology at Google, discussing themes as his career evolved into technical leadership and management, and sharing a few tips on how to learn effectively.
