## Introduction to Writing Effective Article Reviews

### What is an Article Review?
In your professional career you may be asked by a colleague to read their technical article and give feedback, or you may be part of a conference committee or journal editorial board with the responsibility to review submissions that are being considered for publication.  Your job is to provide a review that helps the author to improve their article prior to distribution or publication.

### Structure for a Good Review
A good review has three basic elements:
1. A 1 - 2 paragraph article summary: It is important to summarize your understanding of the article.  This important for two reasons: (i) the summary shows you read the article and (ii) if you misunderstood the article, your summary will make that clear.
1. A description of article strengths: What did you like about the article? Was it technically solid with sufficient breadth and depth?  Did it have a good story line?  Was the author efficient and effective with their words?
1. A description of opportunities to improve the article: How could the article be improved?  Be constructive in your language.  Transform your observation of a weakness into a positive statement of what could be done to improve it.
