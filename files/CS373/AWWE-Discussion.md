- Read the material before coming to class.  You won't be quizzed on it, but do it because it is the right thing to do.
- Discussions will first occur in small groups:

  - As discussion occurs, respect and try to understand all comments made.
  - During the discussion, take notes about key ideas that emerge.  
  - For each key idea, try to identify an example that illustrates the idea.
  - Make sure that everyone has a chance to speak.
  - Make sure each person can see everyone else.
  - Develop a question that you can ask of other teams.
  - Designate a person to speak on behalf of the group to summarize discussion using your group notes.
- Summary discussion will occur with the whole class.
  - Designated speaker for each small group will synthesis group points.
  - Other team members may bring up or clarify group ideas.
