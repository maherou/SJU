| 6:00 pm | Max Helgestad	|Using SVR and ANN to Predict Stock Price |Investors have worked to find better and more efficient ways to predict stock market prices since the inception of the stock exchange. Stock price movement is volatile and sometimes seems unpredictable. Researchers have begun to apply machine learning algorithms to gain more insight on how to accurately predict the future price of a stock. Two algorithms used in this prediction are Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). With the large amount of mathematical reasoning behind these algorithms, they have been able to accurately predict short terms stock trends in some cases. With more time and data, these algorithms could become dangerously accurate and could result in chaotic activity on the stock exchange. As of now, these algorithms remain only moderately accurate, and are an alternative to traditional approaches.  |
| 6:20 pm | Noah Hoberg		|Machine Learning and Computer Security | Machine learning is becoming more and more useful in the growing field of computer security as it is incredibly powerful while being coded in the easily accessible language Python. Machine learning can be used in computer security in ways such as: detecting and classifying domains generated by algorithms, identifying spam text, classifying or clustering threats vs non threats, among many other things. Although Machine Learning can be a very strong tool, it can also be vulnerable to attacks, such as attacks on the training data, or coordinated attacks during the testing phase. Data security and tests for the machine learning pipelines are necessary to know that the models remain valid, otherwise the model could be skewed or made totally invalid. The need for new tools and new understanding in computer security is growing as the field is growing, and the addition of computers usually linked to networks only exacerbates this necessity.|
| 6:40 pm | Abdikaf Jibril| Criminal Justice And Machine Learning| Recidivism is one of the core issues facing our criminal justice department today. It not only jeopardizes the system's ability to keep citizens safe, but it also plays a role in punishment bias. Risk assessment tools to assess recidivism based on risk factors were developed to aid judicial decision-making. Currently, companies with the aid of machine learning have developed 4G risk-needs assessment tools to provide not only risk assessment aid but also case management. These tools' implementation and workings are a mystery to the general public do their black-box nature. Questions have also extended to should these proprietary tools even be used. COMPAS, one of the more well-known 4G risk-need tools used today, is at the center of these questions. 4G assessment tools present a solution to recidivism, but is relying on these tools to aid judicial decision making jeopardized the promise of due process in the justice system. |
| 7:00 pm | Noah Lefebvre|Predicting Heart Disease with Neural Networks |Machine learning (ML) has shown promising results in the field of healthcare. Predictive analysis has begun to be utilized in hospitals. Keeping track of massive amounts of medical data and how the data correlate is impossible for humans. ML in disease prediction is the focus. Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the world. Angiography, the current method of diagnosing heart disease, is an expensive test and carries side effects. Employing neural networks can help reduce cost and risk. Neural networks are often referred to as black boxes. The network is trained on certain inputs and it refines itself until it reaches an accuracy threshold. The goal of this paper is to dive into the operations happening inside the box. Using neural networks in computer aided diagnosis can help reduce cost and improve the accuracy of testing |
| 7:20 pm | Lindsay Will| Machine Learning Applications in Child and Adolescent Development| Development during childhood and adolescence determines physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing into adulthood.  Machine Learning (ML) helps individualize plans for each individual’s developmental needs. This study aims to determine the best methods of ML to use in child and adolescent development. It looks at identifying children that need help and acting on helping them using intangible data such as school performance as well as data collected from physical responses. Already existing methodologies in these areas are examined and critiqued. Suggestions for improvements are given for both data collection and ML algorithms themselves. Results conclude ML combined with human intervention is more effective than human intervention alone and works at 71-81% accuracy depending on the area. These results and suggestions for improvement could eliminate bias in identifying students and make predictions more generalizable and accurate overall.|
| 7:40 pm | Lindsey Hoeschen|Edge Detection Techniques and the Use of CNNs in Computer Vision  | Computer vision is a growing topic and many of its applications require objects to be able to be detected. In order for these objects to even be recognized first the edges that make up those objects need to be detected. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are much faster and more accurate at detecting edges in images as they are not influenced by noise and impurities in the images like other methods. With more research and knowledge of edge detection and their applications I and others can then better understand computer vision. I first researched the background of edge detection then looked deeper into more technical sides of the topic and the use of CNNs in detecting edges and objects. The result is understanding the state-of-the field for edge detection algorithms and using edge detection to find objects. These results with standard edge detection may not be groundbreaking but they are the groundwork for more complicated processes like CNNs. |
| 8:00 pm | Moua Lee| Face Detection| With the capability of computer detecting faces, many smart devices or spaces can provide better security or aid humans in many fields. With face detection being fairly new, algorithms are still trying to provide more accurate detection of different images. Face detection algorithms are used to run through simulation of images, ranging from infrared to being rotated. Through multiple approaches of dividing an image into different regions and categorizing it, the Viola Jones algorithm was able to improve and detect faces more accurately with a variety of images. Additionally, the steps of the Viola-Jones algorithm are broken down to apply improvements in the process of detecting faces. These improvements will help us understand and apply face detection for other purposes.|
| 8:20 pm | Devin Murphy|Ethics of Facial Recognition Technology |Facial recognition is a useful application of artificial intelligence. Despite many possible benefits, it is essential to focus on its ethical concerns. This helps ensure developers maximize positive uses and minimize negative applications. Facial recognition ethical concerns are government surveillance, privacy loss, and use against minorities. I first analyze real world examples of these three ethical issues. This shows how real these concerns are and how they will not dissipate on their own. Next, I examine artificial neural networks, a basic algorithm used for facial recognition. This allows us to understand where and how these ethical issues are introduced. Lastly, I analyze possible future trends and implications of facial recognition. By analyzing societal impacts and how the technology works, people can be more informed on these issues and solutions. Then people can work together to maximize the benefits of facial recognition technology, while minimizing negatives. |
| 8:40 pm | Andy Rothstein|Use of Object Tracking to Gather Innovative Sports Data | Athletes and sports consumers are always looking to gather more data from sporting events. This has led to the use computer vision to find advanced stats. Object tracking is an area of computer vision that has allowed the collection of new forms of data, by analyzing the motion of objects in television broadcasts. This presentation will introduce object tracking and its application within the sports industry. While explaining how spatial-temporal analysis can be used to analyze trajectories gathered from object tracking. The use of object tracking and spatial-temporal analysis allows teams to gain a more complete picture of trends and tactics from games. Computer vision is used to gather new forms of data in sports, and the area of object tracking has a significant role in gathering this innovative data.|

| 6:00 pm | Anton Andrews | AI And Ethics|AI has impacted society and will continue to rapidly evolve over the years. Two impacts from the seemingly endless amounts of ways society can be affected are the benefits and disadvantages of AI. AIs are computer generated machines/technology, hence, they do not possess the capacity to process situations like us humans can, leading to many ethical questions. Since AI has become a part of our daily lives and can possibly become integrated into society on a larger scale, human ethics will become essential for them. Throughout this document I will delve into HCI and AI ethics detailing ethical risks and benefits, as well as possible questions raised regarding AI, backing it up with scholarly sources. At the end of the document, you will understand why it is vital to integrate ethics into AI, so as to reduce risks as much as possible. |

| 7:00 pm | Steffi Tapsoba|Natural Language Processing in today's world |Natural Language Processing (NLP) revolutionized the way we interact with each other and with machines. The advancements of Artificial Intelligence and Linguistics help scientists analyze our languages and make NLP a part of our daily lives. However, some tasks such as irony detection, for example, are harder to perform than others even with the plethora of techniques available. I am seeking to learn about some applications of NLP and the common techniques used. Through research, I was able to gather the information that would allow me to write about the state-of-the-field and present it. I was also able to determine that more research in Linguistics and more performant techniques would better the achievement of some tasks. |
| 7:20 pm | Sam	Young| AI and the Internet of Things|The Internet of Things with the help of AI will change how people conduct their day-to-day lives in the future. In fact, there are already examples of the Internet of Things changing life at home. Advancements in AI are enhancing the effectiveness of Internet of Things devices. These enhancements include features such as object detection and speech recognition. Artificial Neural Networks are at the core of these enhancements. Big Data allows neural networks to learn and become as accurate at their tasks as possible. When projecting into the future, Internet of Things devices will become commonplace in households as well as exist in smart cities. These devices will create a safer and more efficient living environment. |
| 7:40 pm | Randall Clintsman|Bias in Machine Learning | Machine Learning algorithms have helped accelerate different tasks in our society. However, Bias in machine learning algorithms has been a rising issue in multiple industries that implement artificial intelligence. Bias may affect an algorithm’s decision to submit a patient into special care programs, and may affect an algorithm’s evaluation to grant freedom to a convicted criminal. I discuss what machine learning is to give a formal definition. Next, I discuss classification relating it back to decision trees. After, I discuss the Bias/Variance dilemma researchers face when designing a model. Lastly, I analyze the idea of ensemble algorithms with the random forest algorithm. By taking measures to improve algorithms to have less bias, trust can be granted and the application of machine learning algorithms can flourish. |
| 8:00 pm | Will Cooper	| Ethics and Techniques of Online Targeted Media| The internet has become saturated with targeted media. As this new approach to news and entertainment has spread, more user data must be transferred as a result. Privacy concerns have started to develop from the lack of transparency over what this data contains and when it’s being given away. Another danger comes from targeting algorithms' inherent imperfection: a lack of exposure. It relies on showing content similar to what’s already been consumed which can easily trap users in an information bubble. Simply knowing how the media being displayed was chosen can help mitigate this effect. The goal of this paper is to not only raise awareness of the constant data transfers happening behind the scenes of browsing sessions, but to also provide and encourage more transparency with what those transfers consist of.|
| 8:20 pm | Joseph Munsterteiger | Computer Vision At The Dinner Table|Mass agricultural production plays an important role with the ever-growing world population. Moreover, mass production requires more resources including water, fertilizer, disease or pest prevention and management, and labor. Current and future farms need more eyes on their plants to manage properly. Artificial Intelligent technologies, more specifically computer vision and deep learning in cooperation with robotics is the solution to giving these farms the “eyes and brain” ability to produce sustainable mass amounts while also staying optimally environmentally friendly. To do so, this paper focuses on recent discoveries in computer vision within agriculture. Data collection, deep learning with convolutional neural networks, and methods for testing will be covered. Currently, most farms still lose a portion of their annual crops yield to pests or disease that go undetected. Let's fix that. |
| 8:40 pm | Fue Vue	| Components of Self-Driving Vehicles | There is an ethical issue with AI's and job loss. One of the popular AI that's taking over for humans are self-driving vehicles. The problem is not self-driving vehicles, but it is not understanding how these AI's function. There are 5 components of self-driving vehicles that will allow a better understanding on how these components work with each other to allow full control for the AI's. |
