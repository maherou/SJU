## Simulating Solitaire - Part 2

### Goal: Improve the abilities of your Solitaire simulator.

Activities:
- Explore better strategies for winning games.
- Track average number of moves needed for games you win.
- Stretch activity (not required): introduce parallel execution into your Solitaire simulator by enabling simultaneous game playing.

### Competition:
- Prize 1: Best wining percentage.
- Prize 2: Fewest average moves for winnable games.
- Prize 3: Fastest average move time over all games played.

### Report
- Generate a report providing recommendations for which strategies are statistically best, based on your simulation studies.
- Provide this report as part of your final project deliverables, as a Markdown file in your repo.
