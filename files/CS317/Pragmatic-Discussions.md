## Discussion Points for The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey to Mastery

[The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey to Mastery](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/) by [David Thomas](https://pragdave.me) and [Andrew Hunt](https://toolshed.com) is organized in 10 chapters around 53 topics.

### Discussion Guidelines
- Discussions will first occur in small groups:
  - As discussion occurs, respect and try to understand all comments made.
  - During the discussion, take notes about key ideas that emerge.  
  - For each key idea, try to identify an example that illustrates the idea.
  - Make sure that everyone has a chance to speak.
  - Make sure each person can see everyone else (use video features if needed).
  - Develop a question for each assigned topic that you can ask of other teams.
  - Designate a person to speak on behalf of the team to summarize discussion using your team notes.
- Summary discussion will occur with the whole class:
  - Designated speaker for each team will synthesis group points.
  - Other team members can bring up or clarify team ideas.
- Exit quiz:
  - As class ends, each of you will complete a brief quiz based on the class discussion.
